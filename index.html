            <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
            <p>I am Jonas Zagatta, currently Chief Kowledge Office of the company <a
                    href="https://sonah.blog/">S&nbsp;O&nbsp;NAH</a>. Since I don't <del>use</del> <i>have a personal
                    presence on</i> any kind of social media, I made
                this website to share my interests and projects with people who might be interested. I made this with
                the remnants of my school HTML "skills", so feel free to help me improve the sites experience if you
                know how to do it better.</p>
            <p>I hope I will find the time to add projects I am working on (or have worked on), more books that I can
                recommend and also more photos that I have taken. It would also be nice to start a little Blog.</p>
            <p>So let's see if I can get to that.</p>
