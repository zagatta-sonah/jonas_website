            <p>In the early summer I was asked by a student from RWTH Aachen, Chandandeep Singh, to take part in this
                podcast.</p>
            <p>He is doing a podcast about people who's culture it is to build things. I think that fitted perfectly to
                me and it was a lot of fun to talk about my lifestory (if you can call it that) and my professional
                experiences, as well as my philosophies.</p>
            <p>I was really impressed by his professionalism and how well prepared the podcast was prepared! In addition
                to that I had listened to other episodes of his podcast (after I became aware that it existed) and I
                must say I really liked them and was impressed by the amount of helpful information in this "amature"
                podcast.</p>
            <p>In this part of the podcast (I guess more are to come) it's only about my career, how it started and
                where I am now.</p>
            <p>I will embed this video via youtube proxy, so that your data is not tracked even before you watched the
                video.</p>
