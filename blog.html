            <p>Since the summer 2020, we have been working remotely at S O NAH and use a <b>virtual office</b>. It has made our remote working experience massively better.</p>
            <p>I've summarized all there is to learn from this and you can read it <a href="blog_20200120_gathertown.html"><b>here</b></a> or download it as a PDF <a href="blog/20210120_gathertown/How to create a virtual office and why you should.pdf"><b>here</b></a>.</p>

            <p>In the early summer I was asked by a student from RWTH Aachen, Chandandeep Singh, to take part in this
                podcast.</p>
            <p>He is doing a podcast about people who's culture it is to build things. I think that fitted perfectly to
                me and it was a lot of fun to talk about my lifestory (if you can call it that) and my professional
                experiences, as well as my philosophies.</p>
            <p>I was really impressed by his professionalism and how well prepared the podcast was prepared! In addition
                to that I had listened to other episodes of his podcast (after I became aware that it existed) and I
                must say I really liked them and was impressed by the amount of helpful information in this "amature"
                podcast.</p>
            <p>In this part of the podcast (I guess more are to come) it's only about my career, how it started and
                where I am now.</p>
            <p>I will embed this video via youtube proxy, so that your data is not tracked even before you watched the
                video.</p>
