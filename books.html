            <p>This book is unfortunately not availiable in english. But I have translated one paragraph that I
                particularily
                like.
            </p>
            <p class="quota"> "We wake up in the Golden Age of the Restless and will be able to say: When we stepped
                onto the
                streets, the battle for our attention had already begun. The facades screamed at us, the naked charmed
                us from
                the shop windows, there was always something lolling, flattering that wanted to please us better than
                anything
                else. Everything is close-up, everything is at its most extreme, and we in between, the wooed weary.
                That we
                can can not take it anymore, that we are past remedy, that we live in surrender - that, we concealed. We
                merely
                felt it and there were commodities for it: moods and promises that could be bought. One has himself
                relinquished
                the right to be out there. He enters the outside world only by renouncing his worn out, hardly sovereign
                self.
                And even further: We live as the new humans in the middle of a quadruplication of pursuits: Driving,
                eating,
                e-mailing, listening to music, writing, recording messages - all this happens in the same period of
                time. We
                know it, we have a kind of guilty conscience about our ephemerality and we continue to cultivate it, the
                shallow
                attention that makes every detail in it seem less concise, even less impressive. The novelty is probably
                not
                the person looking more curiously at the watch than at his wife's face. The novelty is not even the one
                who looks
                at the screen more interested than at the world and and calls it "digital world", so that it is at least
                still
                semantically similar to the old analogy. What is new is rather that type of "second screen man", for
                whom one
                screen is no longer enough, who cannot bear the world without several parallel actions and in the blend
                of information,
                impulses and image-guided affections is himself kind of a sluggish company dinosaur, impractically
                configured
                and somehow remote and inaccessible. We did not only condemn the present, but also our own presence. We
                thought
                the rooms weren't worth staying in, we ourselves didn't feel made to be here and stay. Even in public
                space,
                the transit zones of pure waiting are shrinking, the deadlines of ineffectiveness and the threat of
                self-contemplation
                are impeding. Music invades, pictures pop up, information buzzes in - uncalled for. New spaces are
                constantly
                opening up and in them new ones again, of consumption, of service offers, and the devices emancipated
                themselves:
                what had been there to open a speech connection was suddenly a mirror cabinet, full of pictures. We
                carried whole
                data heaps with us, meaningfully meaningless, usefully useless condensed news reports, purchase
                incentives, free
                trials, wellness offers. What had been a telephone became a central computer, what was a shirt, a
                thermometer,
                a home became a comfort machine. All modifications resulted in this great comfort and availability,
                which we
                briefly enjoyed, then hardly felt and replaced by a new state of life: Overload, dullness, surrender to
                incapacitation.
                Yeah, we burned out in all that frictionlessness."</p>

            <p>This translation is a work in progress but I hope it can convince you to read this book. It is also
                available
                as an audio book on spotify. I had to stop every couple of seconds to think about the content and so I
                switched
                to the book and thus recommend reading the book version.</p>

            <p>What stuck most with me from this book is not how to run (or not to run) a business but what comes after.
                It really resonates with me that the actual benefit you have from running and then selling a successfull
                company is not money but the chance to spend time with your son all day on the playground.
