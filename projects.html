            <p>I plan to showcase my projects from different domains here.</p>
            <p>In contrast to the blog this section will rather contain references to stuff that is actually
                hosted/posted somewhere else.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>3D Printing</li>
                <li>PopOS / elementaryOS / Ubuntu - tooling and scripts</li>

            <p>I use different screen set-ups with my laptop and was annoyed by the inconvenience of switching between
                different set-ups. So I wrote this GNOME extension, that (for me) does the trick: <a
                    href="https://github.com/zagatta/display_profile_switcher">Display Profile Switcher.</a></p>
            <p>I did this on a sunday because my current set-up was really bugging me. I am curious if this project is
                helpful to anybody else. Once I've tested it more, I plan to also release it to <a
                    href="https://extensions.gnome.org/">extensions.gnome.org</a> (no idea how this works, though).</p>
            <p>There are also more features I would like to add, but I am just putting this out there for now.</p>
            <p>You can read all about my motivation for this project, as well as a full guide on how to <b>install and
                    configure</b> it on the projects <a
                    href="https://github.com/zagatta/display_profile_switcher">github
                    page</a></p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-content" style="margin-bottom:70px">
            <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Install LineageOS with microG and root on
                Galaxy Pixel 3a</h3>
            <p>For my smartphone I have some requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No bloatware</li>
                <li>No proprietary service I have no control over</li>
                <li>Possiblity to use a hostfile to block trackers, malware, etc (imho the only necessary virus
                    protection, but then again, what to I know - please dont hack me)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So I wanted to have LineageOS with microG (for access to GCM, which need for banking) and root (to change
                my hostfile). Unfortunately that seems not to be so easy, even if you have a easily unlockable phone
                like the Pixel 3a. But after some hours I had put together a number of snippets that resembled a
                "solution" to my problem.</p>
            <p>Please not that I did not write most of that code and do not know if all of that is safe to use. But it
                works (for me).</p>

            <p>I wanted to get hibernation running on elementaryOS, but the guides I found didn't work for me</p>
            <p>Then I saw a copy of Linux Magazine where the process was explained in depth, so i wrote my own answer on
                <a href="https://elementaryos.stackexchange.com/a/21915/19681">stackexchange</a></p>
            <p>Maybe this can help somebody in the future</p>
